## üåê Overview

This repository provides a working prototype for high-performance messaging in ROS 2. The standard ROS 2 messaging pipeline often involves multiple data copies and serialization/deserialization steps, which can become a bottleneck for high-throughput applications, especially when dealing with large data payloads like images or point clouds.

`flatros2` tackles this problem by combining:

1. [`flatbuffers`](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers): a highly efficient cross-platform serialization library from Google. It allows accessing serialized data without a parsing/unpacking step, enabling zero-copy access.
2.  [`Eclipse Iceoryx2`](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx2): a true zero-copy inter-process communication (IPC) middleware that uses shared memory.

By integrating these technologies, `flatros2` achieves significantly lower latency and CPU usage for intra-machine communication. This prototype demonstrates a C++/Python image processing pipeline where large image data is passed between nodes with minimal overhead.

## üåü Features

*   **Near Zero-Copy:** Drastically reduces data copies between publishers and subscribers on the same machine.
*   **Efficient Serialization:** Uses Google's FlatBuffers for memory-efficient, access-without-parsing data representation.
*   **C++/Python Interoperability:** Seamlessly pass large data between C++ and Python nodes without serialization/deserialization overhead in the Python process.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by using the provided Visual Studio Code Dev Container, which handles all dependencies and configuration automatically.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   Visual Studio Code
*   Dev Containers extension for VS Code

### Installation and Build

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ekumen-OS/flatros2.git
    cd flatros2
    ```

2.  Open the cloned repository folder in Visual Studio Code.

3.  When prompted, click on **"Reopen in Container"**. This will build the Docker image specified in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, which includes ROS 2 Jazzy and all other necessary dependencies.

4.  Once the container is running and you have a terminal open inside VS Code, continue with the workspace setup instructions below.

## Workspace Setup Instructions

To set up the recommended workspace layout for Flatros2 and ROS 2 core development:

### 1. Create Workspaces and Source Folders

```bash
# Create the main Flatros2 workspace
mkdir -p ~/flatros_ws/src

# Create a separate workspace for ROS 2 core (optional)
mkdir -p ~/ros2-core/src
```

### 2. Import Repositories with vcs

- For the Flatros2 workspace, use the provided `iceoryx.repos` file:

```bash
cd ~/flatros_ws/src
vcs import < /workspace/src/iceoryx.repos
```

- For the ROS 2 core workspace, use the provided `ros2-core.repos` file:

This next step is optional. It allows to have the source code available for instrumentation and debug.

```bash
cd ~/ros2-core/src
vcs import < /workspace/src/ros2-core.repos
```

Continue with the build and setup instructions as described below.

## Troubleshooting & Setup Tips

If you encounter build or permission errors, try the following:

**Fix permissions so colcon can write logs/builds:**

```bash
sudo chown -R developer:ekumen .
```

**Fix missing ACL headers needed by iceoryx:**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libacl1-dev
```

## Running the Demo

The demo consists of three nodes that form an image processing pipeline:

1.  `image_capture_node.py`: A Python node that captures images from a webcam and publishes them.
2.  `edge_detector_node`: A C++ node that subscribes to the raw images, performs Canny edge detection using OpenCV, and publishes the resulting image.
3.  `image_viewer_node.py`: A Python node that subscribes to edge detection output and displays them using OpenCV.
4.  `image_recorder_node`: A C++ node that subscribes to edge detection output and bags it.

To run the demo, open four separate terminals inside the dev container (`Ctrl+Shift+5` or `Terminal > New Terminal`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `image_capture_node.py` requires a webcam. If you don't have one, you can modify it to publish a static image instead.

---

**Terminal 1: Run the Image Capture Node**

```bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_iceoryx2_cxx
export ROS_DISABLE_LOANED_MESSAGES=0
ros2 run flatros2 image_capture_node.py --ros-args -r image:=image/raw
```

Always the `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION` environment variable to `rmw_iceoryx2_cxx` to enable the zero-copy transport.

---

**Terminal 2: Run the Edge Detection Node**

```bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_iceoryx2_cxx
export ROS_DISABLE_LOANED_MESSAGES=0
ros2 run flatros2 edge_detector_node --ros-args -r input_image:=image/raw -r output_image:=image/edges
```

---

**Terminal 3: Run the Image Viewer Node**

```bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_iceoryx2_cxx
export ROS_DISABLE_LOANED_MESSAGES=0
ros2 run flatros2 image_viewer_node.py --ros-args -r image:=image/edges
```

---

**Terminal 4: Run the Image Recorder Node**

```bash
source install/setup.bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_iceoryx2_cxx
export ROS_DISABLE_LOANED_MESSAGES=0
ros2 run flatros2 image_recorder_node --ros-args -r image:=image/edges
```

You should see the real-time edge detection as a video stream pop up in a separate window and an `image_bag` be recorded at the current working directory (careful, the bag can grow large quickly).

> [!CAUTION]
> Iceoryx2 is a still very much a work in progress. Signal handling and QoS support may be lacking.
